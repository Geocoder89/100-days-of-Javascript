* Numbers could be pure integers without decimal points or floating point number
* they are subject to mathematical operation eg addition,subtraction,division etc
* there are also special numeric values which belong to this data type
*
*1) infinity this is the mathematical infinity âˆž. it is a special value that's greater than any number
* 2) NAN is more or less a computational error,it is the end result of an incorrect or an undefined mathematical operation,it is a sticky value and hence where there is a NAN somewhere in a mathematical expression it passes itself across to other values.
*
* 3) these are number types that represent integer values greater than (2^53 - 1) or -(2^53-1) for negatives,the big int values are created by appending n to the integer.

*  a string in js is surrounded by quotes

* it represents nothing,empty or value unknown

*  this makes a type of its own like null but it means that a value is declared but not unassigned

Objects and symbols
* unlike other types that are primitive because they can contain only a single thing,property or value(be it string,number)..they store collections of data or more complex entities.
* symbol is used to create unique identifiers for objects.

/* type of operator
* this returns the type of the argument,it is useful when we want to process values of different types differently or do a quick check
* ways of doing this is
*
* as an operator: typeof x
* as a function: typeof(x)
